      "Summary: Shortly after the mysterious death of the king of Denmark, his widow remarries with Claudius, his brother. The late King's son, Prince Hamlet, is having a hard time after this remarriage. One evening, guards announce that they have seen a spectrum on the rematch.Meanwhile, Hamlet is courting Ophelia, daughter of minister Polonius. Earth is reluctant about the bond between the Prince and his sister. At night, on the outskirts, Hamlet encounters his father's spectrum that reveals to him he was murdered by Claudius. More will be revealed by reading the book. In My opinion: I liked this book because it already contains very popular quotes like to be or not to be the story is very intriguing like why did the king become a ghost?I advise you to read the book because it is very instructive and very intriguing plus it is good for all theater fans.",
